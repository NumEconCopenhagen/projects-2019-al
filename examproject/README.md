# Examproject

In our exam project, we use a variety of methods to develop solutions  to the questions of the exam project, including numerical optimization and analytical calculations using sympy. We address each of the three questions, in order to assess human capital accumulation, solve the ASAD model and find the Walras Equilibrium in an exchange economy.
