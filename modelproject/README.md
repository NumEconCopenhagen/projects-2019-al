# Modelproject

We deal with a model of Cournot competition. Both firms simultaneously set the for them optimal quantities, given the quantity the other firm produces. This is derived by determining the firm's reaction functions and substituting in them the quantity of the other firm. The project is structured as follows: We first briefly explain the model and preliminaries, solve the model both algebraically and numerically, visualize our results in both a static and an interactive way, and lastly, calculate prices.
